Handling source terms
#################################

This tutorial can be of interest to researchers working with reactive flows data sets.
We present how source terms of the original state
variables can be handled using **PCAfold** software.
Specifically, **PCAfold** functionalities accommodate treatment of sources
of Principal Components which can be valuable for implementing PC-transport
approaches such as proposed in :cite:`Sutherland2009`.
